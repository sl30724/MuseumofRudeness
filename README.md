## About

Museum of Rudeness is a personal project inspired by my love for traveling and all the interesting cultural nuances Iâ€™ve learned from friends I met on my journeys over the years.

Every trip I took expanded my mind and gave me the ability to take the perspective of others. And I wanted to share these valuable learnings with people in a fun, interactive way.
